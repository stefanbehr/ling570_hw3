My tagger ended up achieving an accuracy score of 93.68%, after tagging 23026 morphemes.
This means that the tagger mistagged roughly 1455 morphemes.

Of the errors committed by the tagger, there were at least 586 errors where the tagger
mistagged morphemes as NNC, at least 203 incorrect NPR tags, at least 93 incorrect NNU
tags, at least 90 incorrect XSV tags, at least 67 incorrect NFW tags, and so on.

Given that over half of the tagger's errors were in misapplying the tags for common
nouns and proper nouns, this should be an area of focus in any efforts to improve the
tagger. Notably, it seems that a fair number of the morphemes which were mistagged as NNC
should have in fact been tagged NPR. It also seems that a large number of morphemes
which were mistagged as NPR should have been tagged as other types of nouns. Clearly,
this version of the tagger doesn't do very well in distinguishing between different types
of noun.

It might be possible to improve the tagger's performance by adding word boundary tags.
This would add the benefit of sensitivity to the word-level structure of the training
and testing corpora without sacrificing the advantages of tagging at the morpheme level.

Another possible improvement to the tagger might be to make it sensitive to whether or 
not any tags in either the training or test sets represent a choice between two tags
(e.g., NNC|VV, etc.).
